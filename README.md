# SIPJunior
A lean SIP client that can be stripped for parts

This application lets you register on a SIP server and make/receive calls. 

This application does not read any user data apart from that which is entered as part of the configuration. 

This application also does not upload any data to the developer's or any other site/server save for the interaction with your defined SIP server
